  4년차 웹 개발자로 주로 SI/SM/솔루션 경험했으며 주로 <mark>솔루션</mark> 개발을 했습니다. <br>
  <br>
  자동화 프로세스를 개발, 비효율적인 프로세스를 개선하는 일을 좋아합니다.<br>
  SI과정에서 반복적으로 발생되는 수정 작업을 자동화 시켜 솔루션의 유용성을 높였습니다. 또한 솔루션에서 다양하게 사용되는 특정 모듈을 프로세스화 시켜 자동화 시킨 경험이 있습니다.<br>
  <br>
  <mark>ElasticSearch</mark> 도입, <mark>백오피스 개발</mark> 등과 같은 솔루션에 필요한 프로세스들을 맡아왔으며
  이미 구축 된 프로세스 개선을 통해 구축 프로세스 소요시간을 60%가량 감소 시킨바가 있습니다.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.
